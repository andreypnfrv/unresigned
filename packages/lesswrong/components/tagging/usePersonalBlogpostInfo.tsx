    <p><b>Personal Blogposts</b> are posts that don't fit {site}&apos;s Frontpage Guidelines. They get less visibility by default. The frontpage guidelines are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Timelessness</em>. Will people still care about this in 5 years?</li>
      <li><em>Avoid political topics</em>. They&apos;re important to discuss sometimes, but we try to avoid it on {site}.</li>
      <li><em>General Appeal</em>. Is this a niche post that only a small fraction of users will care about?</li>
